## Hello There
I'm a Master of Philosophy (MPhil) student in applied mathematics and statistics.
My research is exploring using stochastic differential equations to model uncertainty in Lagrangian data assimilation.
There is a bit of jargon there, but I'm basically looking at ways in which we can improve predictions of where objects or quantities, such as heat or pollution, end up when pushed around by a fluid, such as the ocean.

I've been learning and using Julia in my research. 
I'm also learning Rust in my spare time.

This Github profile contains a variety of projects and bits and pieces from all of that and more.
